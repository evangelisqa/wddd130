        <h2>Why Rafting?
            <p>Most parts of rivers, usually the most beautiful parts, are hard to reach on land. Rafting allows you to enter these special places. Imagine dens forests, nature, great views and much more. Even though we live in houses, flats and 
            big cities we truly belong in the nature. er rafting is one of the most popular adventure sports in India. The diverse topography of the Indian landscape with its many rivers and tributaries presents some of the most challenging 
            routes for rafting</p>

        <h2>Rafting Breaker</h1>
            <p>At its most basic, river rafting involves the paddling of boats or rafts (that are inflatable) and steering them down a river in the midst of swirling waters. Usually, the rapids are classified based on the conditions of the water, 
               ranging from one to six. These grades indicate an increase in the intensity and difficulty as the numbers go up. Rapids categorised as ‘1’ are mainly recommended for children and beginners and those above ‘5’ are dangerous and are not 
               meant for leisure rafting. As rafting has gained popularity as a recreational activity over the last 60 years there have been many improvements in equipment and safety standards. Today raft designs take many forms and in some places 
               they need not be necessarily paddled or rowed as motorised rafts are available. Another popular variety of raft is the hybrid raft, which has oars as well as the paddles. This enables passengers to distribute the tasks of paddling and 
               oaring among themselves.</p>
